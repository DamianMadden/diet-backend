# Diet Planner Backend

This is app is the back end for a diet planner, real title to be determined.

In combination with the front end it intends to generate a diet plan based on some general information about the user and as much as possible remove the associated burden of work/choice involved in getting the food to your mouth.

## Contributing

At this point my assumption is that nobody wants to contribute anything, feel free to let me know if that's not true, I'll be considering how to license this code later on
